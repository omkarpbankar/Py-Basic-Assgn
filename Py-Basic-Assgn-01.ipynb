    "A string is a data type for a sequence of characters like \"iNeuron Full Stack Data Science Batch-2021\". As we can observe from the example, we can also include numbers, punctuation and even line breaks by using '\\n' for new line. On the other hand, strings can not be used for calculation, evenif your string is just a number eg. 2021. We need to convert it to a number data type first to perform mathematical operation. \n",
    "Furthermore, as a programmer, we have to define the sting by butting single quotes('') or dobule quotes(\"\") around whatever you want to classify as a string. Nevertheless, the string data type is primarily used for reading and writing data. \n",

    "A variable is a name that can be refer to any value. When writing a program, you can assign the value to a variable. \n",
    "for example:\n",
    "a = 10 : Here 'a' is variable which stored the value of 10 as a integer data type. \n",
    "b = \"Omkar Pandit Bankar\" : In here, 'b' is a variable which stored the value of a string data type. \n",
